# DX Monorepo

A modern, contract-centric and type-safe TypeScript monorepo focused on correctness, best practices and developer experience.

## Highlights

- Contract-centric
- Autogenerated OpenAPI and clients
- Automated checks and testing
- Fast builds and tooling

## Stack

- `Typescript`
- Runtime `bun`
- Package Manager `pnpm`
- Build `turbo`
- Contract `zod` + `zod-openapi`
- Backend `h3`
- Frontend `Vite`, `React`, `React Query` and `TailwindCSS`
- Testing `Vitest`, `Schemathesis`
- Tooling `Oxlint`, `Oxformat`, `Lefthook`

## Dependencies

- pnpm (will install everything else)
- docker (for schemathesis tests)

## Quick start

```sh
# install dependencies
pnpm install

# run all projects in dev mode
pnpm dev

```

## Project Structure

```
apps/
├── backend/      # API server
└── frontend/     # Web application

libs/
└── api-contract/ # Shared API schemas and OpenAPI spec
```

## Testing

Unit tests with Vitest.

**Property-based API testing** with Schemathesis automatically generates hundreds of test cases from the OpenAPI contract, validating that the backend correctly implements the spec and handles edge cases.

```sh
# unit tests
pnpm test

# schema-based tests
./schema-test.sh
```

All checks run automatically on every push via GitHub Actions.

> **Note:** The monorepo setup is production-ready, but the example apps are for demonstration only.
